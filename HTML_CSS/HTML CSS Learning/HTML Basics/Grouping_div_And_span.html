                        There are many more footages of Unknown Flying Objects(UFO) flying in the sky.
                        These UFO fly in such a way that seems to be breaking laws of physics and<br>
                        that technology seems to be far from level of Human Intelligence. 
                        Most of the videos may be fake or CGI(Computer Generated Imagery) but some
                        of them are recorded from official military sources.<br>
                        Rescently a Round White Disk was seemed to be flying around the orbit of Mars.
                        The footage was taken from International Space Station(ISS).<br>
                        The disk didn't look like a normal object. It was travelling in very high speed and
                        was rotating at the same time. Motion path followed by that UFO was unnatural.<br>
                        It seemed like there was no any inertia acting on that object. It changed its 
                        direction without any short delay. That instant change in position was scary.<br>
                        According to ISS, they recieved high beam of Plasma being radiated from that UFO.
                        The source of that plasma beam is estimated to have energy equivalent to half<br>
                        of the energy contained in our star Sun. Concerntrating that humungous amount 
                        of energy in such a small disk is beyond Human understanding of Science.
